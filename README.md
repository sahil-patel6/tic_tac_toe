# tic_tac_toe

This game is made with C language. 

1) You should have a C compiler(gcc compiler) to compile the source code and play the game.

2) It uses CLI(Comman Line Interface), I will soon launch GUI for this game.

3) It is in beta, stay tuned I will update to stable in the next release.

HAPPY CODING.......
